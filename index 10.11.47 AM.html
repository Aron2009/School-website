                <p class="text-muted text-left">Christ the King Catholic is proud to be a Catholic Community of Caring School. Our school strives to promote, model, and teach six key values. These values are Faith, Family, Caring, Trust, Respect, and Responsibility. All activities, interactions, and planning begins with these values at the core. We believe that all students will benefit from practicing these values when it comes to decisions both now and in the future.

                    The Catholic Community of Caring philosophy is exciting because it permeates every aspect of our school. The six core values are incorporated into classroom learning, extra-curricular activities, school awards, playground activities, and our Catholic celebrations.</p>

                <p>Mother, help our faith! Open our ears to hear God’s word and to recognize His voice and call. Awaken in us a desire to follow in His footsteps, to go forth from our own land and to receive His promise. Help us to be touched by His love, that we may touch Him in faith. Help us to entrust ourselves fully to Him and to believe in his love, especially at times of trial, beneath the shadow of the cross, when our faith is called to mature. Sow in our faith the joy of the Risen One. Remind us that those who believe are never alone. Teach us to see all things with the eyes of Jesus, that He may be light for our path. And may this light of faith always increase in us, until the dawn of that undying day which is Christ Himself, your Son, our Lord!</p>

Even though we are unable to celebrate our student artists together this year, we will still acknowledge and recognize all their wonderful creations! Here are three ways to enjoy Artwalk. Chief Superintendent Dr. Bryan Szumlas, Board Chair Mary Martin, Bishop William McGrattan and Arts and Culture Liaison Holly Schile give greetings. This year, we're excited to unveil and open the doors to the first ever Calgary Catholic Artwalk Interactive Virtual Gallery. Finally, the 2020-2021 collection of student work has been placed in a digital book for individual viewing. Click or scroll through the book to experience and see a detailed image of all the pieces-index by school at the back.
